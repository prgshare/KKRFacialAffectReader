# About
KKR Facial Affect Reader (KKR-FAR) is a GUI-based system to estimate valence and arousal from a facial video.
KKR-FAR estimates and visualizes the intensity of valence and arousal in real time from a video of a single face.
Either a video file or a video data captured by a web camera can be used for the facial video.
