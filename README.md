Estimation of valence and arousal from a facial video

# About
KKR Facial Affect Reader (KKR-FAR) is a GUI-based system to estimate valence and arousal from a facial video.
KKR-FAR estimates and visualizes the intensity of valence and arousal in real time from a video of a single face.
Either a video file or a video data captured by a web camera can be used for the facial video.

The following image shows the GUI-based system of KKR-FAR. 
Top left, input video; top right, current valence and arousal intensity values, represented as a point in two-dimensional space; bottom, graph showing changes in intensity values.

After the estimation, KKR-FAR summarizes the estimation results as shown in the following figure, including temporal changes in valence and arousal intensity throughout the entire video, and the distribution and frequency of intensity values, indicated by color changes.
KKR-FAR is easy to use and will be helpful for the analysis of the estimation result of valence and arousal.
